#    How to Make Custom Signs
#-------------------------------

# You can use any number of these:
#   takePlayerItems
#   givePlayerItems
#   takeShopItems
#   giveShopItems

# OR just one of these (also you cannot use redstone and items in the same operation!)
#   givePlayerRandomItem
#   setRedstoneOn
#   setRedstoneOff
#   setRedStoneOnTemp
#   toggleRedstone

# AND you can add stack any of these with the above.
#   takePlayerMoney
#   givePlayerMoney
#   takeOwnerMoney
#   giveOwnerMoney
#   playerIsOp <- for OP only signs
#   setDayTime
#   setNightTime
#   setRaining
#   setClearSkies
#   healPlayer
#   repairPlayerHeldItem

#   Note: If you use something like setrain + clearskies, or
#         redstoneon + redstoneoff, then only one of the two will happen.

# ----------------------------------------

# You can change the sign names, but don't use a sign name longer than 14 characters.
# Note - If for example you remove or rename Buy, then ALL Buy signs will be removed! Keep this in mind!
# Note 2 - If you add a new sign, make sure you add the messages below as well!
